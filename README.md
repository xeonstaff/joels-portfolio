# About
I'm Joel-- a web developer with tons of cross-industry experience in science, education, research, and social media. Generalist par excellence. Serial hobbyist:
chess, podcasting, tiktoking, hiking, lifting and, well, etc.

# Future Directions
This is one of few projects that just...make sense, for now. Next steps: make much, /much/ better projects to showcase in portfolio. Then, I'll overhaul the portfolio in 2030.
